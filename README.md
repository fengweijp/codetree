# antlr4-ast

This project aims to provide a straightforward way to create an AST from an ANTLR4 grammar, without
needing to walk through the parsed tree generated by ANTLR4 manually.

In particular, the generated AST models should be completely decoupled from the underlying grammar
specifics. Two languages that are theoretically equivalent but use a different syntax should be
able to generate the exact same AST models.
